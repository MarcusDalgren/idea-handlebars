# IDEA-Handlebars:  An Intellij IDEA plug-in for [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates

IDEA-Handlebars adds support for Handlebars templates Intellij IDEA 10.5

The key feature of this early version of the plugin is that it allows most of the power of the built-in IDEA HTML
editing utilities to be used with Handlebars syntax inserted in the markup.  Future versions will build out more
Handlebars-specific utilites.

## Features
* Configurable syntax highlighting for Handlebars code
* Matched mustache pair highlighting
* Full HTML highlighting, code-completion, inspections, formatting and commenting for the HTML content in your Handlebars templates
* Since Handlebars is a super-set of [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) syntax, this plugin should greatly improve IDEA's editing experience for Mustache templates too

## Not yet implemented
* Handlebars-specific syntax-error highlighting
* Find usages, Go-to declaration, etc. for references
* Support for Handlebars templates embedded in script tags in html files

## Compatibility
* This branch contains the IDEA 10.5 compatible version of this plugin.  See master branch for Intellij IDEA 11.
